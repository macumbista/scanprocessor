Scan processing is an analog electronic image manipulation technology which emerged in the late 1960’s, reached its apex during the 1970’s, and was largely made obsolete by digital computing in the 1980’s. During this period, scan processing instruments such as the Scanimate (1969) and the Rutt/Etra Video Synthesizer (1973) revolutionized commercial animation and inspired a generation of experimental video artists.

Generally speaking, a scan processor manipulates the electronic signals which make up the raster of a video image before it is displayed on a Cathode Ray Tube. The affordances it provided to artists and animators of the 1960’s and 70’s were rather unique. Unlike in a normal CRT television or video display, where the shape and size of the raster are fixed, in scan processing the raster can be scaled in size and translated in screen position electronically, causing images to fly across the screen, twist and turn, warp and change shape, and even appear to rotate in 3D.

The Macumbista Scan Processor project aims to create a basic analog electronic workflow for basic scan processing operations which combines elements of the Rutt/Etra, the Scanimate, and the Optical Electronics Inc 3D Display Modules. We base this project on existing resources in the modular video synthesis ecosystem such as the LZX Cadet modules. The intended form factor of the synthesizer is 4U, however it should be possible to build it in 3U EuroRack format using existing modules or by wiring any customs boards here to a 3U front panel.
